Question 7.
The data set that we are conducting these experiments on includes diseases other than just measles which we spent a majority of the time manipulating. All of these sets seem to indicate a decline in the disease with the rise of vaccines. There are also many credible sources that seem to indicate this same idea.

Question 8.
  1. There are many problems with the claims made by this paper. When a person makes an assertion they are then burdened with having to give logic and facts to their reasoning and findings. However when there exists only a small set of data and no one else to contradict you, many people will believe you to be a credible source. This in turn will spread through news and word of mouth causing many people to distrust vaccines and putting others at risk.

   2. The role of this should be to ensure that the information that is being given is in fact correct to begin with. If it is peer-reviewed, there is a lower risk of false information spreading.  

   3. No though the person may retract his claim, it has already been spread and is now widely known. The topic spreads faster than people have time to correct it. And others usually tend to believe that older information is more "correct" than new findings. I would say the only way this can be rectified is if there are scientists who specialize in this field that repeatedly assure people that it does not cause autism and to release publications about this topic informing people about the news of current events revolving around these topics.

Anything that you would want to inquire about the benifits of vaccines can be found here. This gives detailed information about how much it prevents any of the given diseases mentioned.


Question 10.
There were many things that I learned from this talk. It was very informative and encouraging to hear. I think the part that resonated with me the most would be how unbelievably easy it is to misconstrue data in order to achieve a specific result. It really solidifies the idea that correlation does not equate causation. They talked about a website and it gave a list of correlations ranging from the amount of margarine consumed to divorces in Maine and the amount of movies featuring Nicholas Cage and the amount of deaths by drowning. It really gives thought to the idea of what they said. Be skeptical and question everything.
